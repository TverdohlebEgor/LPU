This is the first step in my *Road to God Engineer* project. As the natural beginning of my journey into discovering the deepest corners of computers and programming, I will "build" a CPU from scratch. Everything I study before starting and my thoughts during the process will be documented in the `notes.md` file.

# NB
Everything I write will inevitably contain errors. Feel free to use them for any non-commercial purposes, but please keep in mind that these are notes from someone who is currently studying.
