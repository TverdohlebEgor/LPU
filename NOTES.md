## Chapter 0:Introduction 

### 0.1:Backgrond
At 20 years old, I've been casually programming for 4 years and professionally for 1. One day, while watching a video about CPUs, I realized I knew absolutely nothing about how anything works—from how the computer actually operates to how my "magic words" make magic things happen on the screen. My curiosity couldn’t stand the basic notion I had of how my code came together, so I had an idea: Why not build everything from scratch? Maybe that way, I’ll understand at least something.

Clearly, becoming a true master at something is a long-lasting mission (usually good old death will catch up with you before you’re fully satisfied) so my computer will be a lot simpler than the LLM-creating machines of today. Still, I feel like it will be a long but fun journey into exploring this beautiful world.

### 0.2 Aim of LPU:
As mentioned earlier, building a real modern CPU is way out of scope for this project, so here are the goals I will strive for:
* Understand the basics of electronics and how logic gates actually work.
* Gradually understand more and more complex circuits.
* Design a functional CPU from scratch.
* Create a simulation of the CPU.  

Right now, building a physical copy of this CPU is not a goal, but we’ll see how burnt out I get from this specific project.

### 0.3: Lama?
Here are the absolutely compelling reasons behind the name of this particular CPU built from scratch:

## Chapter 1: Electronics

### 1.1: How can I not know this stuff?
Even the people closest to me would probably be surprised by how many basic things I actually don’t know. Electronics is definitely one of those areas. While it’s not strictly necessary for coders, I still feel kind of ashamed of my lack of understanding, even of the most basic concepts. Since we’re here for that reason, I’ll start from the beginning and continue until I feel the depth of my knowledge is sufficient for this project.

### 1.2: How electricity works
*Everything* is made of atoms, and atoms are made of three components:
* Protons (positively charged)
* Neutrons (neutraly charged)
* Electrons (negativally charged)

Protons and Neutrons are clamped together into the nucleos while the electrons are free to flow around them (attracted by the protons since they have opposite charging)

In some materials some electrons on the border of the atom can move to others atom while in other this doesn't happen. This mark the difference between:
* *Conducter* (former)  
* *Non conducter* (later)

When multiple electrons flow in a single direction they form *electricity*
We have differente measurement for electricity
##### Columbs
Rappresent a group of electrons. Since electricity is formed when a *huge* number of electrons flow together one columbs is equivalent to ${tex'6.241 * 10^18'}
